Introduction
Managing personal finances efficiently is crucial in today’s fast-paced world. This Expense Tracker project introduces the concept of data storage and management in software systems to solve real-life finance tracking problems.

The different expenses are represented as objects in the program, similar to nodes in data structures. Each expense has its own details such as amount, category, and date. These are stored in a collection for easy access, update, and analysis by the user.

In the tracker, the program starts by initializing an empty list of expenses. Users can then add new expenses, each becoming an “entry” in the list. Over time, as expenses accumulate, the user can view all expenses or calculate total expenditure to understand their financial situation.

What is an Expense Tracker?
An Expense Tracker is a personal finance management tool that allows users to:
-Record all income and expenses
-Categorize spending for analysis
-Generate insights into daily and monthly expenditure patterns
These systems are widely used for budgeting, financial planning, and improving money management skills.

How does it work?
The algorithm of this program operates with a menu-driven recursive approach to maintain user interaction until exit.
The program structure is as follows:
-Add Expense:
Prompts the user for amount, category, and date. Creates a new expense object and adds it to the list.
-View Expenses:
Displays all recorded expenses with their details in an organized format.
-Calculate Total:
Calculates and displays the total sum of all expenses recorded.
-Exit:
Terminates the program.

Understanding the Algorithm
The algorithm for this Expense Tracker was designed based on standard data entry and retrieval principles commonly taught in introductory programming courses. It uses object-oriented programming to represent expenses and employs an interactive loop to process user inputs efficiently.
